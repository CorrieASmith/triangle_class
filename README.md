# triangle_class
This is an app that receives three numbers from the user and returns what type of triangle, if any, that it is. 
This is our first time experimenting with creating our own classes. 
We've been focusing on writing clear, concise specs with sound logic.
We have also been going through our code line by line and making sure everything makes sense.
